While 3 − 4 × 5 can also be written 3 − (4 × 5), that means something quite different from (3 − 4) × 5. In reverse Polish notation, the former could be written 3 4 5 × −, which unambiguously means 3 (4 5 ×) − which reduces to 3 20 − (which can further be reduced to -17); the latter could be written 3 4 − 5 × (or 5 3 4 − ×, if keeping similar formatting), which unambiguously means (3 4 −) 5 ×.

# Basic Order

3 - 4 x 5 
3 - (4 x 5)
	= 3 - 20 = -17 (Order of operations)

# Order

(3 - 4) x 5
	= (-1) x 5 = -5
